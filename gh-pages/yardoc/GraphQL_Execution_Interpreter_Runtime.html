<p>Class: GraphQL::Execution::Interpreter::Runtime &lt; Object
This class is part of a private API.
I think it would be even better if we could somehow make
<code class="highlighter-rouge">continue_field</code> not recursive. “Trampolining” it somehow. 
Instance methods:
add_dead_path, after_lazy, arguments, authorized_new,
continue_field, continue_value, dead_path?, directives_include?,
evaluate_selections, final_value, gather_selections, initialize,
inspect, resolve_type, resolve_with_directives, run_directive,
run_eager, set_type_at_path, type_at,
write_execution_errors_in_response, write_in_response,
write_invalid_null_in_response</p>
