<p>Class: GraphQL::Schema::FieldExtension &lt; Object
Extend this class to make field-level customizations to resolve
behavior. 
When a extension is added to a field with <code class="highlighter-rouge">extension(MyExtension)</code>,
a <code class="highlighter-rouge">MyExtension</code> instance is created, and its hooks are applied
whenever that field is called. 
The instance is frozen so that instance variables arenâ€™t modified
during query execution, which could cause all kinds of issues due to
race conditions. 
Direct Known Subclasses:
GraphQL::Schema::Field::ConnectionExtension,
GraphQL::Schema::Field::ScopeExtension,
GraphQL::Subscriptions::SubscriptionRoot::Extension
Instance methods:
after_resolve, apply, initialize, resolve</p>
