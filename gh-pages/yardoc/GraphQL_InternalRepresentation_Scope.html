<p>Class: GraphQL::InternalRepresentation::Scope &lt; Object
At a point in the AST, selections may apply to one or more types.
Scope represents those types which selections may apply to. 
Scopes can be defined by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A single concrete or abstract type - An array of types - <code class="highlighter-rouge">nil</code> 
The AST may be scoped to an array of types when two abstractly-typed
fragments occur in inside one another. 
Instance methods:

</ul>
