<p>Class: GraphQL::StaticValidation::ValidationContext &lt; Object
The validation context gets passed to each validator. 
It exposes a GraphQL::Language::Visitor where validators may add
hooks. (Language::Visitor#visit is called in Validator#validate) 
It provides access to the schema &amp; fragments which validators may
read from. 
It holds a list of errors which each validator may add to. 
It also provides limited access to the TypeStack instance, which
tracks state as you climb in and out of different fields.
